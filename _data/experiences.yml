  details: "I studied the large ciliate Stentor coeruleus, a model for single cell 
  regeneration. I was heavily involved in the Stentor genome project, generating and 
  analyzing RNA-Seq data, and discovered Stentor's unusual 15 bp intron size.

  I have also been analyzing the global kinome of Stentor, which contains >2000 kinases.
  Recently we have been using this data to reveal a role for CDK1 homologs in regeneration."

  details: "I studied the maintenance and replication of the plastid genome in the 
  Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. I constructed conditional genetic mutants and 
  used fluorescence microscopy and qPCR assays to show that the histone-like HU protein 
  is essential for apicoplast DNA replication and proper plastid segregation."

  company: Laboratory of Dr. Michele Klingbeil, UMass Amherst
  details: "I examined the function of the mtDNA polymerase PolIA in the parasite Trypanosoma 
  brucei. I used RNAi to knock down this non-essential gene and designed assays to DNA damaging
  agents to probe a function in mtDNA repair."

  details: "I was investigating the role of p53 in DNA double strand break repair. I worked with 
  mice and measured rates of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining in p53+/+, 
  p53+/-, and p53-/- mouse cells. "
