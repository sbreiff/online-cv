- experience:
  role: Senior Data Modeler/Analyst
  time: 2022 - present
  company: Seven Bridges Genomics
  details: "Data modeler on the data harmonization team. We are working to enable an automated end-to-end solution for data 
  governance and harmonization for all the datasets we serve, starting with data discovery and cataloging to data quality
  and data modeling. I develop data models, using common data models when possible, and extending them to insure the integration 
  of clinical and genomic data."
- experience:
  role: Senior Data Curator
  time: 2021 - present
  company: Harvard Medical School
  details: "Senior data wrangler working primarily with the CGAP project (Clinical Genomics Analysis Platform),
  an end-to-end platform facilitating genomic data analysis from raw data alignment to variant interpretation. 
  I lead data model development and help guide development of features such as the variant interpretation module. 
  I also handle data submissions and onboard new users and projects."
- experience:
  role: Data Curator
  time: 2018 - 2021
  company: Harvard Medical School
  details: "Data wrangler working primarily with the 4D Nucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center,
  a repository for genomics and microscopy experimental data and metadata. I work with a large consortium 
  of labs to implement data standards and adhere to FAIR principles. I use REST APIs with python to 
  manage data and metadata, and contribute to data model development. I optimized the portal's processing 
  of ontologies, and contributed new terms to the Experimental Factor Ontology."
- experience:
  role: Postdoctoral Scholar
  time: 2012 - 2018
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Wallace Marshall, UCSF
  details: "I studied the large ciliate Stentor coeruleus, a model for single cell 
  regeneration. I was involved in the Stentor genome project, generating and 
  analyzing RNA-Seq data, and discovered Stentor's unusual 15 bp intron size."
- experience:
  role: PhD Student
  time: 2006 - 2012
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Boris Striepen, UGA
  details: "I studied the maintenance and replication of the plastid genome in the 
  Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. I constructed conditional genetic mutants and 
  used fluorescence microscopy and qPCR assays to show that the histone-like HU protein 
  is essential for apicoplast DNA replication and proper plastid segregation."
- experience:
  role: Undergraduate Researcher
  time: 2004 - 2006
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Michele Klingbeil, UMass Amherst
  details: "I examined the function of the mtDNA polymerase PolIA in the parasite Trypanosoma 
  brucei. I used RNAi to knock down the gene and designed assays with DNA damaging
  agents to probe a function in mtDNA repair."
- experience:
  role: Summer REU Intern
  time: 2005
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Joseph Jerry, UMass Amherst
  details: "I was investigating the role of p53 in DNA double strand break repair. I worked with 
  mice and measured rates of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining in p53+/+, 
  p53+/-, and p53-/- mouse cells."
