    Senior data wrangler working primarily with the CGAP project (Clinical Genomics Analysis Platform),
    an end-to-end platform facilitating genomic data analysis from raw data alignment to variant interpretation. 
    I led data model development and helped manage development of features such as the variant interpretation module. 
    I also handled data submissions and developed software for ingestion.
    <ul>
      <li>Onboarded new users and projects</li>
      <li>Managed new data submissions</li>
      <li>Led interviews with clinicians to understand user needs</li>

    Data wrangler working primarily with the 4D Nucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center,
    a repository for genomics and microscopy experimental data and metadata. I work with a large consortium 
    of labs to ingest new datasets, implement data standards, and adhere to FAIR principles. I use REST APIs 
    with python to manage data and metadata, and contribute to data model development. I optimized the portal's 
    processing of ontologies, and contributed new terms to relevant biomedical ontologies.

  role: Postdoctoral Scholar
  time: 2012 - 2018
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Wallace Marshall, UCSF
  details: "I studied the large ciliate Stentor coeruleus, a model for single cell 
  regeneration. I was involved in the Stentor genome project, generating and 
  analyzing RNA-Seq data, and discovered Stentor's unusual 15 bp intron size."
- experience:
  role: PhD Student
  time: 2006 - 2012
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Boris Striepen, UGA
  details: "I studied the maintenance and replication of the plastid genome in the 
  Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. I constructed conditional genetic mutants and 
  used fluorescence microscopy and qPCR assays to show that the histone-like HU protein 
  is essential for apicoplast DNA replication and proper plastid segregation."

  role: Undergraduate Researcher
  time: 2004 - 2006
  company: Laboratory of Dr. Michele Klingbeil, UMass Amherst
  details: "I examined the function of the mtDNA polymerase PolIA in the parasite Trypanosoma 
  brucei. I used RNAi to knock down the gene and designed assays with DNA damaging
  agents to probe a function in mtDNA repair."

  details: "I was investigating the role of p53 in DNA double strand break repair. I worked with 
  mice and measured rates of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining in p53+/+, 
  p53+/-, and p53-/- mouse cells."
